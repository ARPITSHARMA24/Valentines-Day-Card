            <h1>7th Feb 2025 – Our First Movie Date & Cafe Hangout ❤️ </h1>
            <h2>
            Today was something special, something we’ll always remember, our first-ever movie date. It wasn’t just about watching Sanam Teri Kasam, it was about being together, feeling every moment, and experiencing something new side by side. Some days just hit different, and today was one of them. Started off with a movie date—Sanam Teri Kasam. 💔 Matlab, full emotional rollercoaster tha, aur tujhe dekh ke toh aur bhi zyada feel aayi. Kabhi movie dekh raha tha, kabhi tujhe. 😏
            </h2>
            <h2>
            Sitting next to you in the theater, I could feel the warmth of your presence. Every time you looked at me during the emotional scenes, I saw so much in your eyes—care, love, and a silent promise that we’d always share moments like these. It was our first, but definitely not the last.
            </h2>
            <h2>
            Phir café gaye with Nidhi ☕. Vibe was chill, and conversations were effortless. You know how I love just sitting with you, talking about random things, making fun of each other—it’s the best feeling. Nidhi ke saath thoda aur mazedar ho gaya, full masti and teasing. 😂
            </h2>
            <h2>
            And me? I could see how you were looking at me today—like you were admiring me, feeling lucky, feeling safe. Woh feeling jab tu mujhe dekhti hai, jaise bas tujhse better kuch ho hi nahi sakta, that’s what makes everything so worth it.

            </h2>
            <h2>
             Aur haan, tere expressions... Matlab, tu jab mujhe mazaak mein maarne aati hai ya phir khud hass ke face chhupa leti hai, woh moments are gold. 🤭📸 Jo bhi ho, spending time like this, bina kisi extra effort ke, just being us—that’s what makes it special. 💙
            </h2>
            <h2>
            This wasn’t just another day; it was our day. And every day spent with you is a day worth remembering. Here’s to many more firsts, many more laughs, and endless love. ❤️
