            <h1>To My Dearest Girlfreindd. </h1>
            <h2>
              Today, as the world celebrates Rose Day, I celebrate you. Because no rose, no matter how beautiful, can ever match the radiance of your smile, the warmth of your embrace, or the fragrance of your love that fills my life.
            </h2>
            <h2>
              From the moment you walked into my world, you became my most beautiful chapter, my sweetest melody, and my deepest emotion. Every heartbeat of mine whispers your name, every breath carries your essence, and every moment with you feels like poetry written by destiny itself.
            </h2>
            <h2>
             Tonight, as we watch Sanam Teri Kasam, I want you to know—our love is not just a story, it’s an eternity in the making. You are my always and forever, my sunshine in the day, my moonlight in the dark. You are the one who turns my silences into laughter, my fears into strength, my loneliness into a love so deep, it makes the universe envious.
            </h2>
            <h2>
             No matter where life takes us, I promise you—just like today, I will always choose you, in this lifetime and beyond. You are not just my love; you are my home, my destiny, my forever.

            </h2>

            <h2>
              I love you more than words can ever say, and I always will.
