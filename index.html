</h1>
            <h2>
            My Sweetest Swati,
            </h2>
            <h2>
           If I could, I’d give you a teddy as soft as your hugs, as warm as your heart, and as comforting as your presence in my life. But even the fluffiest teddy could never compare to the way you make me feel—safe and loved.
            </h2>
            <h2>
            You are my real-life teddy bear, the one I want to hold close on every good day, bad day, and all the little moments in between. Your love wraps around me like the coziest embrace, making my world softer, brighter, and full of warmth.
            </h2>
            <h2>
           Just like a teddy, I promise to always be there for you—to cuddle you when you're tired, to cheer you up when you're down, and to be your constant source of love and comfort.
           
            </h2>
            <h2>
              Today, I wish I could be right next to you, hugging you tight, whispering how much I adore you, and seeing that beautiful smile of yours. But until then, close your eyes and imagine me there, holding you like the luckiest person alive—because that’s exactly what I am.
            </h2>
            <h2> 
              Aaj to pure din hi gussa kiya hai tune lekin mere pe. Anyways..
            </h2>
            
            <h2>
            Happy Teddy Day, my love! Always yours.🐻❤️
